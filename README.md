PC-AI: Modular AI Engine for Private Credit Underwriting
PC-AI is a modular, intelligent system designed to transform private credit underwriting. Rather than relying solely on black-box machine learning models, this framework captures the structured logic used by professional bank credit analysts and builds a scalable, auditable system for credit decision making.
What PC-AI Does
PC-AI offers a complete end-to-end approach for credit evaluation, providing:
An explainable AI engine that mimics human credit judgment
A structured rulebook that transforms financial indicators into underwriting actions
A simulation engine that stress-tests borrower resilience across scenarios
Together, these components offer a powerful decision support tool for fintech startups, private credit funds, and digital lenders.
Modular Components

1. Decision Tree Engine
Replicates how real world credit officers think that is weighing borrower entity type, key financial ratios, management quality, and operational context and arriving at one of three decisions: APPROVE, CONDITIONAL or Reject.

2. Intelligent Lending Rulebook
Maps red flags (like low DSCR, high leverage, or missing group disclosures) to precise lender actions such as rejecting the loan, capping exposure, or demanding co-guarantors. It bridges traditional policy thinking with dynamic decision logic.

3. Simulation-Driven Underwriting
Allows users to run stress tests by adjusting revenue and cost assumptions. The engine estimates borrower sustainability through DSCR projections and surfaces alerts for early intervention. This ensures risk is viewed not just historically but prospectively.
 Use Cases
Fintechs building lending engines can plug in PC-AI modules for rule based decisions.
Banks and NBFCs can digitize their underwriting SOPs into this logic framework.
Startups targeting embedded credit solutions can use it to assess partners or customers.
AI/ML teams can layer datasets on top of this structure to train supervised or hybrid models.

Why This Matters
Credit is context-driven. Most AI models lack visibility into the strategic, operational, and behavioral patterns lenders rely on. PC-AI is built differently every decision point is explainable and grounded in actual bank credit training principles.

It’s designed to be open, extendable, and realistic respecting the complexity of lending while still driving automation.

Looking for Collaborators
This is just the starting point. If you’re a:
Fintech founder or product manager
Risk modeler or credit expert
Python or Streamlit developer
Policy or governance specialist

there’s space to contribute. The goal is to co-create a next-gen, modular, explainable credit platform.
