## 🚀 What It Does

- 🔍 Upload borrower JSON profiles (like SME, mid-cap, or startup borrowers)
- 📊 Run a structured underwriting engine
- 🧠 Output decisions: APPROVE, CONDITIONAL, REJECT
- ⚠️ Highlights red/yellow flags with detailed explanation
- 🧾 Uses logic from bank credit SOPs, not just ML

## 🧠 Key Modules

1. **Unified Decision Engine**  
   Simulates credit committee logic, counts red/yellow flags, and issues clear, auditable outcomes.

2. **Borrower Profile Format**  
   Inputs include DSCR, leverage, inventory, cash flow, group exposure, off-balance risk, and more – all structured to replicate credit underwriting thought processes.

3. **Explainable Results**  
   Lists all risk flags by module so decisioning is transparent, auditable, and compliant with real-world lending governance.
